    "Crime in the city of Minneapolis is destroying the ability for citizens to be contributing members of society, and increase our GDP. If we can identify which neighborhoods within the city of Minneapolis are most prone to police interference based on past data we could then reduce crime in these neighborhoods by installing recreational centers, or community watch.
